In this project use:-

HTML = class, id, div, input, p, h1, button etc. all of class's use in style and id(text) use for js.

CSS = there are use various style effect.

Bootstarp = use for responsive page.

Js =  behind the logic three function play--

formdata() = add a javascript event listener onclick method into the button to call the function.
btoa()     = this function creates a base-64 encoded ASCII string from a "string" of binary data.
atob()     = this function decodes a string of data which has been encoded using base-64 encoding.

After that use a some variable and style to display.
You can also check it by console to remove the command.
